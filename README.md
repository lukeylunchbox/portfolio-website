# Luke's Portfolio Website
### www.lukecolcott.netlify.com

## Target audience
My primary intended audience is employers. I'd like this site to act more as a visual portfolio to store all of my work (once I've got some to show).
It is a lot more visually aesthetic than just a simple Github link.
Secondly, this site could function as a simple way for other developers to contact me to collaborate or just discuss code. 

## Design Goals
My website was created to satisfy the following criteria;
- Friendly and inviting landing page
- Design reflects my style and personality
- Compatible with multiple devices of multiple resolution
- One page setup
- Page features downloadable resume

# Inspiration for my website

Being completely new to design, I really struggled to conceptualise an idea.
I decided to make the website reflect me and my personality. At least that would be a good place to start.
I knew I loved urban environments. I am very much a city kid. To me, there's something hypnotic about the chaotic life in a busy city.
I spent three years living in some of Asia's biggest cities, no doubt perpetuating my love for the hustle and bustle.

I needed to bring this together into a design. I decided it would be based on cities. It needed to illustrate a busy, generic city, yet symbolise some sort of individualism. 

To achieve the generic city mood, I decided to go black and white. To create individualism, I decided to sparingly use a really 'out-there' colour.
That's me. I can be a little out-there. 

Of course, all this had to be done tastefully. I love the idea of minimalism, however I'm afraid of boring. My initial images were to be of Asian cities where I've lived. However finding the perfect image after many, many hours of searching wasn't going well. Until I found a perfect city image of Melbourne.    

## Pinterest Mood Board and Figma

Initially, I was going for a lot of colours. I'm fairly outspoken at times, so I felt this was appropriate. 
I loved the city images of Hong Kong and other parts of China, having lived there for a few years. I also love the sea and everything logistics, hence the shipping and ports images.

After selecting the image I thought suitable, I chose a color scheme to match.

After creating the above image in Figma, I then realised there was a bit too much going on for a landing page.
I felt the image was distracting. Back to the drawing board!

After creating an assortment of different style and colour schemes, I decided to go black and white.

black-and-white
All the colour seemed distracting. I ended up going super-minimalist, with a hint of colour. Aquamarine!
As soon as I saw the contrast of the aquamarine on a black and white image of Melbourne, I knew I'd found my combination.

This was the mock up design and colour palette I ended up with. I still cannot believe how long the design process took. Even though the style is simple, it took me many, many hours to agree with myself on.

Next it was onto fonts.

## Fonts

As I knew nothing about font whatsoever, it was research time. The most important this I learnt was that fonts need to be paired.
I spent a long time hanging around Google Fonts to find my perfect font.
Even then, the fonts I liked didn't compliment each other. I did some more research and found an 'approved' partner for Raleway. That was Roboto Slab.

Finally, the design of my logo.

Obviously it had to be modern. A style that would suit my city landscape theme.

Initially I wanted to display my initials, however I got excited with the circular design and just went with a cursive 'L' in a circle;

## Build Challenges

The build started surprisingly well. In one day I was able to almost complete the site, from start to finish.
Being my first website, I was very happy with this progress.

Day 2, then came the problems.. Although I was building with the 'mobile first' mentality, I was having some compatibility issues on the desktop version. I found it difficult to get a view of my Melbourne city image that I liked on all devices.

Thankfully, I found a CSS property called background:position.
This way I was able to position the main building in the image to be the center of a mobile screen.

I used the relatively new Flexbox property over and over so the website was responsive. Flexbox definitely saves a lot of time. 

Once the website was written, the last stage was to host it. For this I used Netlify.
Netlify made the process very easy, and deals with form handling. I can now accept form submissions directly via my personal email address.

After a little bit of code cleaning and using Mozzilamize on my background images to compress them to smaller sizes, I have achieved a Google rating of 81.
